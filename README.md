A curated list of delightful [Vorpal.js](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal)-based projects and extensions.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.

## Projects built with Vorpal

Vorpal is Node's first framework for building immersive CLI applications. These are projects built on top of Vorpal.

- [Wat](https://github.com/dthree/wat) - Community-built syntax cheat-sheets for every language, platform and library.
- [Vantage.js](https://github.com/dthree/vantage) - Vorpal with wings: `CLI` + `SSH` + `REPL` for your live Node app.

## Vorpal Extensions

Vorpal supports community extensions, which add to the functionality of Vorpal programmatically, or on the fly.
